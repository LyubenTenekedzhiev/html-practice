    <h3><strong>How do I see the differences between HTML and CSS?</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>What is the difference between the usage of <strong>HTML and CSS?</strong></li>
        <p>Html gives a structure to the website and CSS is for styling</p>
        <li>What is the newest version of <strong>HTML?</strong></li>
        <p>HTML5</p>
        <li>What are the top five most used <strong>HTML5 elements?</strong> If not sure, make a guess.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>div</li>
            <li>h1</li>
            <li>unordered/ordered list</li>
            <li>button</li>
            <li>form</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Have you checked out the <strong>HTML5 cheatsheet?</strong></li>
        <p>I last checked it 4 months ago, so I probably have to revisit <a href="https://www.wpkube.com/html5-cheat-sheet/" target="_blank">this site.</a></p>
        <li>What is the difference between <strong>semantic and non-semantic</strong> elements?</li>
        <p>I think that the semantic elements(header, footer, headings) help us organise the page and give its content, whereas the non-semantic ones(div, span) only help us styling it later on.</p>
        <li>Why do we prefer using <strong>semantic elements?</strong></li>
        <p>We prefer using semantic elements because the content is considered as 'king' in web development and when using semantic ones other programmers have an easier time understanding our code.</p>
        <li>Do all <strong>browsers support</strong> all of the newest HTML / CSS elements?</li>
        <p>Not all browsers (for instance Internet Explorer) get updated that fast, which means that some features might not be supported from them. </p>
